# Preliminaries
# =============
#
# Set the variabels (The executable is in the build tree). Do the
# basic checks to see if the executable is made or if the defaults
# file exists (basicchecks.sh is in the source tree).
prog=mkprof
img=ellipticalmasks.fits
execname=../src/$prog/ast$prog
cat=$topsrc/tests/$prog/inputascanvas.txt





# Skip?
# =====
#
# If the dependencies of the test don't exist, then skip it. There are two
# types of dependencies:
#
#   - The executable was not made (for example due to a configure option),
#
#   - The input data was not made (for example the test that created the
#     data file failed).
if [ ! -f $execname ] || [ ! -f $img ]; then exit 77; fi





# Actual test script
# ==================
$execname $cat $img --mforflatpix --oversample=1 --inputascanvas  \
          --output="inputascanvas.fits"
