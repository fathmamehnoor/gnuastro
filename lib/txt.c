  characters). The UNITS, TYPE, BLANK tokens are optional, if not given,
  default values will be set. But if there are comments, then the brackets
  themselves are required to separate the name from the comments.

  Any white space characters before or after the delimiters (':', '[', ']',
  ',') is ignored, but spaces within the values are kept. For example, in
  the two following lines, NAME will be set to 'col name' (even though
  there are extra spaces in the second line, The column unit will be
  set to 'col unit'.

  When the column type is a string, the number of characters in the string
  is also necessary, for example 'str10'. Without an integer attached, the
  line will be ignored.

  In the case of an error or mis-match, the line will be ignored.
